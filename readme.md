A little Javascript to swap through some text modules on a WordPress page

Because Elementor (lite) does not have a kind of content slider, I had to code some Javascript to flip through some testimonials.
This is actually used on https://biancaflaschner.com

The script goes to a code or html module at the bottom of the page in question.
The style can be added to the Customizer
The HTML structure is actually a wrapping section, the DIVs containing the text are usual text modules. Just add the id's and class names
